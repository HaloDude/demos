  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious 
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little 
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following 
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
